Customer segmentation is a marketing process in which the customers are divided into different groups based on their demographics, purchasing habits and interests. The purpose of this process is to analyze which customers are profitable for the business and which are not. In which way, marketing department of an organization can make customized campaigns to retain these customers and maximize their ROI (Return on investment). RFM Model is one of the ways for customer segmentation.

# RFM (Recency, Frequency and Monetary) Model:
RFM (Recency, Frequency & Monetary) analysis is a behavior-based technique used to segment customers by examining their purchasing history based on three factors:
-	**Recency:** How recently a customer has purchased?
-	**Frequency:** How often do they purchase?
-	**Monetary:** How much the customer spends?


It is based on the marketing axiom that:

RFM helps to identify customers who are more likely to respond to promotions by segmenting them into various categories.

_RFM Model is based on three steps:_

1.	Calculate RFM Metrices/Values
2.	Building RFM Scores and RFM Segment
3.	Grouping into Name Segments

## 1.	Calculate RFM Metrices/ Values


Calculate the following columns according to each customer.
-	**Recency:** Their most recent purchase date.
-	**Frequency:** Number of purchases within a set time (i.e., one year).
-	**Monetary:** Total sales from that customer

## 2.	Building RFM Scores and RFM Segment


Assign a number from 1 to 5 for each category, where 5 is the highest and 01 is the lowest. To calculate RFM, we´ll use the RFM Values columns that has been created in the previous step.

## 3. Grouping into Name Segments


Following is the RFM table. This simple approach of scaling customers from 1-5 will result in, at the most, 125 different RFM scores (5x5x5), ranging from 111(lowest) to 555(highest). Each RFM cell will differ in size and vary from one another, in terms of the customer’s key habits, captured in the RFM score.
